- Test extension loads in Ulauncher

**Accomplished**:
- Created git repository in `/home/user/Documents/AI/Morgen-Tasks/`
- Initialized with main branch
- Created `.gitignore` for Python, logs, and sensitive data
- Created directory structure:
  - `extension/` - holds extension code
  - `development/` - research, prototypes, scratch work
  - Subdirectories: src, images, logs, tests, docs
- Created CHANGELOG.md with v0.1.0 entry
- Created this development log

**Issues**:
- None yet

**Next Steps**:
- Create logs/issues.md and logs/improvements.md
- Set up Ulauncher extension directory
- Create placeholder icon
- Create manifest.json with preferences
- Create main.py with basic Extension class
- Test extension in Ulauncher

**Notes**:
- Using semantic versioning (0.x.y for pre-release)
- Morgen API list endpoint costs 10 points - caching is critical!
- Due dates must be exactly 19 characters: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss

# AI Agent Handoff

**Reason**: User requested session end

## Current Task
Post-v1.1.0 development — small fixes and v1.2.0 roadmap planning.

## Progress Made
- Fixed create-task UX: first dropdown item is now the actionable "Create: <title>" (previously was a non-actionable header)
- Updated TODO.md: collapsed v1.1.0, created v1.2.0 roadmap with candidates, added due-date autocomplete task
- Committed and pushed to origin/develop

## Next Steps
1. Decide v1.2.0 scope from candidates in TODO.md
2. Implement due-date autocomplete (`@` suggestions dropdown)
3. Evaluate other v1.2.0 candidates (SUG-03, background refresh, filter by priority, task list metadata)

## Files Modified (uncommitted)
- None (working tree clean)

## Notes for Next Agent
- Current branch: `develop` (up to date with origin)
- Recent commit: `3d0b89a fix: make Create the first actionable item in task creation dropdown`
- v1.1.0 is released on main + GitHub Releases
- v1.2.0 roadmap candidates are in TODO.md under "v1.2.0 Roadmap"
- The "Make first dropdown item actionable" task is already marked complete in TODO.md

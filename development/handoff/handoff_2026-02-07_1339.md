# AI Agent Handoff

**Agent**: GPT-5 (Codex CLI)
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-07 13:39
**Reason**: End of session (natural break)

## Current Task
Finalize session after completing task list support refinements, enter-behavior changes, and documentation/protocol updates.

## Progress Made
- Finalized task list support around real payload fields (`taskListId` + `integrationId` fallback).
- Added/updated list commands and debug field dump behavior.
- Removed `Task Open URL Template` preference from extension settings.
- Set normal-mode task Enter behavior to no-op.
- Added git maintenance protocol document and pointers in docs.
- Created short no-op-enter test checklist and task-list test plan updates.
- Committed recent work on `develop`.

## Next Steps
1. Push local commits from `develop` to `origin/develop` (branch is ahead by 3).
2. If desired, run a quick manual smoke test in Ulauncher for `mg`, `mg help`, `mg d <query>`.
3. Continue backlog work (e.g., SUG-03 threshold optimization) as next coding task.

## Files Modified (uncommitted)
- None (working tree clean)

## Notes for Next Agent
- Current branch state: `develop...origin/develop [ahead 3]`.
- Recent commits:
  - `0508247 docs: add git maintenance protocol pointers`
  - `2c4e975 fix: remove unsupported settings-open action from help`
  - `77ff93a fix: make normal task Enter a no-op and remove open-url setting`
- Ulauncher docs/API do not provide a reliable action to directly open extension settings from an item action; help now shows manual navigation guidance.

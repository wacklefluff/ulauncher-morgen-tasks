# AI Agent Handoff

**Agent**: GPT-5.2 (Codex CLI)

**Reason**: User requested end of session

## Current Task
Phase 6 polish + QoL improvements for the Ulauncher Morgen Tasks extension.

## Progress Made
- Phase 3 complete: list/search tasks + one-shot refresh + formatter.
- Phase 4 complete: create tasks (`mg new ...`) with due parsing.
- Phase 5 started: disk-persistent cache across restarts.
- Phase 6 started: polish and operational UX:
  - Added help (`mg help`, `mg ?`) and cache clear (`mg clear`).
  - Added rotating runtime file logging (`extension/logs/runtime.log`) and helper to fill it for rotation testing.
  - Improved error messages with actionable tips + runtime log pointer.
  - Added UI actions to open/copy runtime log path, including on welcome/missing-API-key and fallback error screens.

## Latest Manual Test Results (User Reported)
- v0.6.1: PASS `L01–L08`
- v0.6.2: PASS `R01–R08`
- v0.6.3: PASS `E01–E11`
- v0.6.4: PASS `O01–O05` (except O05 originally; fixed in v0.6.5)
- v0.6.5: PASS `W01–W05`

## Next Steps
1. Phase 6 UI polish:
   - Better priority indicators in `extension/src/formatter.py`
   - Overdue highlighting (if due date parsing supports comparing dates reliably)
2. Optional: add “Open runtime log” / “Copy log path” in the main task header too (not only help/errors).
3. Phase 7: add unit tests for `DateParser` and `TaskFormatter` (new `extension/tests` setup).

## Files Modified (uncommitted)
- None (working tree clean)

## Notes for Next Agent
- TODO.md now has a “Release Checklist” that should be used for every feature/fix; completed tasks should include version tags like `(+v0.6.5)`.
- Rotated log files are ignored via `.gitignore` (`*.log.*`).
- Commands to validate quickly: `python -m compileall extension`

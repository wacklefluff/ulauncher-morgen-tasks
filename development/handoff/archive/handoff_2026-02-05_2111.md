# AI Agent Handoff

**Agent**: GPT-5.2 (Codex CLI)
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-05 21:11
**Reason**: Natural break (Phase 3 implementation complete)

## Current Task
Phase 3: list/search Morgen tasks in Ulauncher, with force refresh and improved display formatting.

## Progress Made
- Added task formatting module (`extension/src/formatter.py`) with `TaskFormatter` and `get_priority_icon()`.
- Updated `extension/main.py` to:
  - List all tasks when query is empty
  - Filter by title/description when query is provided
  - Force refresh with `mg refresh` or `mg !` (supports `!<query>` and `refresh <query>`)
  - Copy task ID on Enter when supported (fallback to close)
  - Show cached tasks on rate-limit/network errors
- Updated docs/logs for v0.3.0:
  - `CHANGELOG.md`, `TODO.md`, `README.md`, `extension/logs/dev_log.md`

## Next Steps
1. Manually test in Ulauncher: restart with `pkill ulauncher && ulauncher -v`, then try `mg`, `mg <query>`, `mg !`, `mg refresh`.
2. If behavior looks good, commit changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "feat: list and search tasks"`.

## Files Modified (uncommitted)
- CHANGELOG.md
- README.md
- TODO.md
- extension/logs/dev_log.md
- extension/main.py
- extension/src/formatter.py
- development/handoff/handoff_2026-02-05_2111.md

## Notes for Next Agent
- `CopyToClipboardAction` import is guarded; if the Ulauncher environment doesn't provide it, Enter falls back to closing the window and the header hint changes accordingly.
- API list endpoint is still limited to 100 tasks (`list_tasks(limit=100)`); consider pagination later if needed.
